A Twiter Bot that examines data to determine who is winning the war on Christmas.

The bot parses all incoming tweets containing 'Christmas' or 'Holidays' and does some rudimentary 
analysis to determine if the tweet is wishing someone a happy Christmas or happy holidays.  The bot 
reports out every 12 hours with the latest statistics.
